# Voxot

This is a work in progress, and is not intended for production usage yet.

### Including in a project

__NOTE:__ This is meant to be used with another project that includes build scripts for GDNative Development: [gdnative-project](https://github.com/hlfstr/gdnative-project)

Include this project as a submodule of your base directory.  Ensure that it is stored in the `source/include` directory so it is compiled with your source.

```sh
$ git submodule add https://github.com/hlfstr/voxot source/include/voxot
```
